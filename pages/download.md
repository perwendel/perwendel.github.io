<h1 class="no-margin-top">A Lightweight Web Framework</h1>
Spark Framework is a true micro Java web framework. Its total size is less than a megabyte, and to keep it lean and clean we decided to cut support for Java 7 in Spark 2. If you are stuck with Java 7 for whatever reason, you unfortunately have to have to use Spark 1.

## Download Spark Framework
Spark Framework is available both on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22spark-core%22) and [GitHub](https://github.com/perwendel/spark).

### Maven Users
Add the following snippet to your [POM](http://maven.apache.org/pom.html):

{% include macros/mavenDep.md %}

## Non-maven Users
Clone the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com/perwendel/spark).\\
If you really want to, you can also download Spark Framework as a [ZIP (from GitHub)](https://github.com/perwendel/spark/archive/master.zip)
